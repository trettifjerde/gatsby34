Built for a gaming community with 3000+ registered members, the website features:
- authentication system
- a forum
- a real time messaging system
- a complex form for uploading player made mission files
- an admin panel for user and content management
- a game replay viewer
I worked on the front end, implementing the given graphic design and connecting the client side to the backend written in **C++**, so I made it in plain **JavaScript** and **HTML**.
The most fun I had was developing [the game replay viewer](https://sg.zone/replays/1705087203)
This utility:
- gets a JSON file of player positions and in-game events
- recreates the match in browser on a map, using the Leaflet library
- calculates and displays the overall match statistics
