A blog for a startup. Has **reCAPTCHA** protected forms.
Submitted form data is stored in a **Mongo** database. Upon form submission, the server sends emails both to the user, confirming that their request is received, and to the site owners, notifying them of a new request.
Dynamic pages content is collected from .md files and is regularly revalidated and cached, so no rebuilds after content updates are needed.
*The owners are currently filling the pages with content, so the website is not deployed on the
official domain yet.*
