Pages are rendered from **.md** files and are **revalidated regularly** - no need to rebuild the website when the content is updated.

Webshop functionalities are implemented using Paddleâ€™s APIs.

The two forms (Newsletter Subscription and Contact Us) are protected with **reCAPTCHA Enterprise**.

The backend **stores** the form data **in the Mongo Atlas database** and **sends emails**: a confirmation letter to the user and a notification letter to the site administrator
