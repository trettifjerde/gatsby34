Pages are **rendered from .md** files, using **incremented static regeneration** - no need to rebuild the website when the content is updated.

Webshop functionalities are implemented using **Paddle**â€™s APIs.

The two forms (Newsletter Subscription and Contact Us) are protected with **reCAPTCHA Enterprise**.

The backend **stores** form data **in a MongoDB database** and **sends emails** on form submission: a confirmation letter to the user and a notification letter to the site administrator
