An app for sharing recipes and keeping shopping lists.
Signing up is done on the server. Passwords are hashed. Sessions are managed using **JWT**. A middleware guards protected routes.
Shopping lists can be managed manually or updated with ingredients from any recipe in just one click. Items with the same name and units stack automatically.
Data is stored in a **Mongo Atlas** database and cached both on server and client, so the number of calls to the database is reduced.
Recipe images get uploaded to third-party image hosting upon form submission.
