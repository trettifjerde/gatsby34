My name is **Sasha**, and I'm a 29-year-old graduate linguist living in Osijek (Croatia) and making a career switch to become a **web developer**. 

I've always had a fascination for programming, but never dared to dive into it until I already had a job. I began learning it in my free time as a hobby, only to find out I enjoy it far more than my actual work. **For the last four years**, I've been taking **online courses** and **building web apps** for the people I know. You can read more about some of the apps on this website.

**Currently**, I'm more proficient in **frontend** than in backend, but I constantly work on my backend skills as well. I want to be able to implement any aspect of a web application (and to do it well), and I hope to work **fullstack in the future**. Now my **skill set** looks like this:

1. 
    **★★★** *Feel most comfortable working with:*
    <div class="circles">
    <div class="l">JavaScript</div>
    <div class="l">TypeScript</div>
    <div class="l">React</div>
    <div class="l">Redux</div>
    <div class="l">Next.js</div>
    <div class="l">REST API</div>
    <div class="l">CSS/SCSS</div>
    <div class="l">HTML/JSX</div>
    <div class="l">Git</div>
    </div>

1. 
    **★★** *Know my way around:*
    <div class="circles">
    <span class="l">Angular </span>
    <span class="l">MongoDB</span>
    <span class="l">Sanity CMS</span>
    <span class="l">SQL</span>
    <span class="l">Python</span>
    <span class="l">Django</span>
    </div>

1. 
    **★** *Got some knowledge of:*
    <div class="circles">
    <span class="l">Gatsby</span>
    <span class="l">GraphQL</span>
    <span class="l">Vue</span>
    <span class="l">HTMX</span>
    </div>

My biggest wish right now is to join a team of people taking pride in their work, to learn from them and with them. I'd be thrilled if I could contribute to making applications that **share knowledge**, **connect people** and **make everyday life a bit easier**.

1. 
    `I truly enjoy:`
    - making things work exactly as planned
    - solving all sorts of puzzles
    - figuring things out on my own
    - learning languages, both natural and programming ones
    - refactoring
    - debugging
1. 
    `...as for these - well, not so much:`
    - developing design from scratch (cheers to graphic designers!)
    - unit testing (cheers to testers!)

If you want to see whether I'm a good fit for your team or you'd like to test my knowledge, don't hesitate to [contact me](/#backToTop)!
