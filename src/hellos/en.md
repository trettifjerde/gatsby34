My name is **Sasha**, and I'm a **web developer**.

I'm more proficient at **frontend** than at backend, but I find learning backend development fascinating and I'm hoping to work fullstack one day.

Right now my skill set looks like this:

1. 
    **★★★** *I feel most comfortable working with:*
    <div class="circles">
    <div class="l">JavaScript</div>
    <div class="l">TypeScript</div>
    <div class="l">React</div>
    <div class="l">Next.js</div>
    <div class="l">CSS/SCSS</div>
    <div class="l">HTML</div>
    <div class="l">Git</div>
    </div>

1. 
    **★★** *I know my way around, but often double-check while working with:*
    <div class="circles">
    <span class="l">Angular </span>
    <span class="l">SQL</span>
    <span class="l">MongoDB</span>
    <span class="l">Python</span>
    <span class="l">Django</span>
    </div>

1. 
    **★** *I've got some knowledge of:*
    <div class="circles">
    <span class="l">Gatsby</span>
    <span class="l">GraphQL</span>
    <span class="l">Vue</span>
    </div>

Currently, I live in **Zadar, Croatia**. I don't mind moving to **another city**, though preferably not to another country because I like Croatia a lot **<3**

1. 
    `I truly enjoy:`
    - making things work exactly as planned
    - solving all sorts of puzzles
    - learning languages, both natural and programming ones
    - brainstorming ideas with teammates
    - refactoring
    - debugging

1. 
    `...as for these - well, not so much:`
    - coming up with graphic design ideas (god bless you, graphic designers)
    - unit testing (god bless testers, too)
