My name is **Sasha**, and I'm a **web developer** - more proficient at **frontend** than at backend, but I find learning backend development fascinating and I hope to work fullstack in the future.

Previously, I worked as a Norwegian language tutor and proofreader. I've always preferred **learning languages** to teaching them. At some point, I started catching myself longing for what my software developer students were doing - **solving all sorts of puzzles** while creating things that **spread knowledge**, **connect people** and **make everyday life easier**. So I began learning how to do the same.

Right now my **skill set** looks like this:

1. 
    **★★★** *Feel most comfortable working with:*
    <div class="circles">
    <div class="l">JavaScript</div>
    <div class="l">TypeScript</div>
    <div class="l">React</div>
    <div class="l">Next.js</div>
    <div class="l">REST API</div>
    <div class="l">CSS/SCSS</div>
    <div class="l">HTML</div>
    <div class="l">Git</div>
    </div>

    **★★** *Know my way around:*
    <div class="circles">
    <span class="l">Angular </span>
    <span class="l">SQL</span>
    <span class="l">MongoDB</span>
    <span class="l">Python</span>
    <span class="l">Django</span>
    </div>

1. 
    **★** *Got some knowledge of:*
    <div class="circles">
    <span class="l">Gatsby</span>
    <span class="l">GraphQL</span>
    <span class="l">Vue</span>
    </div>

I live in **Zadar, Croatia**, but I would gladly **move to another city** to join a team where people take pride in their work - and I would **give my absolute best to contribute**.

1. 
    `I truly enjoy:`
    - making things work exactly as planned
    - learning languages, both natural and programming ones
    - figuring things out on my own
    - brainstorming ideas with teammates
    - refactoring
    - debugging

1. 
    `...as for these - well, not so much:`
    - coming up with graphic design ideas (cheers to graphic designers!)
    - unit testing (cheers to testers, too)

Currently, I'm open to work, so don't hesitate to [contact me](/#backToTop)!
